Ingredients
5 to 6 cups confectioners' sugar
2 cups sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup water
1 to 2 teaspoons anise, lemon or orange extract
Red, yellow or orange liquid food coloring


Fill a 15x10x1-in. pan with confectioners' sugar to a depth of 1/2 in.  make a continuous curved-line indentation in the sugar; set pan aside.
In a large heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cover and continue cooking for 3 minutes to dissolve any sugar crystals.
Uncover and cook on medium-high heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 300Â° (hard-crack stage). Remove from the heat; stir in extract and food coloring if desired.
Carefully pour into a glass measuring cup. Working quickly, pour into prepared indentation in pan. Cover candy with confectioners' sugar. When candy is cool enough to handle, cut into pieces with a scissors. Store in a covered container.
